# Babu's Artificial Neural Network

This repository contains an implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate learning about important aspects of ANN implementations.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts behind artificial neural networks.
- Learn how to implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with customizable architecture from scratch.
- Explore various activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms commonly used in neural networks.
- Understand the process of training neural networks using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD).
- Learn how to evaluate the performance of neural networks.

## Features

- Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with customizable architecture.
- Support for various activation functions including sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax.
- Implementation of common loss functions such categorical cross-entropy (CCE).
- Training using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) support.
- Evaluation using accuracy and CCE loss.
- Extensible design for easy integration of additional functionalities.

## Usage

The provided Jupyter Notebook (`MLP.ipynb`) serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and experimenting with the artificial neural network implementation.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to further develop this implementation by organizing it into a Python module for easier integration into other projects. Additionally, I aim to add more features and optimizations to enhance its functionality and performance.
